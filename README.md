# CardGame
Welcome to my CardGame, BlackJack.

INSTRUCTIONS AND RULES:
This game is a 2-player and has 3 rounds. 

The player who reaches the value closest to 21 through their total hand value wins each round.

If a player reaches 21, they automatically win the round.

If a player reaches a round greater than 21, they automatically lose, and their opponent wins that round.

To start off, each player is given 2 starting cards. These 2 cards will add up to their starting value.

Each player will be asked whether to "hit" or "stand" when it is their turn. 

In this instance, each player can see each other's cards.

Key words:

To "hit" is to draw another card to increase their total hand value so that they can reach a number closer to 21.

To "stand" is to not draw a card and remain at their current hand value, to prevent reaching over 21 and losing.

To get a "BlackJack" is to reach a total hand value of exactly 21, resulting in the player losing.

To reach a "bust" is to reach a total hand value of over 21, resulting in the player losing.

The best out of the total 3 rounds wins the game. 


HOW TO RUN:
Go to the Game class and press the green play button near the top right button.


CONSOLE AND WINDOW:
The instructions and user prompts will be displayed in the IntelliJ console.

The card visuals for each player and their total hand value will be displayed in the seperate window.

At the end, the overall winner will be displayed on the console.


Have fun!
